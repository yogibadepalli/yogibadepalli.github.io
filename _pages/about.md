I am a researcher in Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a deep curiosity about how machines can learn and understand language the way humans do. I hold an MSc in Data Science from the University of Sussex, where I developed strong skills in machine learning, NLP, and scientific computing.

Right now, I’m working as a Research Assistant at the University of Sussex, where I’m part of a team exploring new ideas in deep learning. I’m especially interested in self-supervised learning — how models can teach themselves from raw data — and building NLP systems that are smarter, more adaptable, and grounded in real-world use.
