**Data Analyst | Data Scientist | Research Enthusiast**

I’m a data analyst and aspiring data scientist with a deep passion for research, data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization. I hold an MSc in Data Science from the University of Sussex, where I developed strong expertise in machine learning, data-driven decision-making, and applied analytics.

Currently, I’m working as a Research Assistant at the University of Sussex, contributing to projects in the field of data science. My goal is to use data not just to explain the past, but to shape the future — whether through innovative research, impactful models, or insightful visual storytelling.
